On the class Titanium site for Problem 2, you are given the following four files defining a simple linked
list class called IntegerList: IntegerList.h, IntegerList.cpp, IntListNode.h and IntListNode.cpp.
There is also a file called test.cpp that allows testing of this list containing integers. An IntegerList
object contains one pointer pointing to the first or front node of the linked list. An IntListNode object
contains an integer and a pointer to another IntListNode object following it. The main function in
test.cpp allows you to insert integers at the front of the list and to print all integers in it.
Add a member function to the class IntegerList called AddAtPosition that takes as parameters an
integer to be placed in the list and a number indicating the position where the new integer should be
inserted. IntegerList.h has the member function heading in the public part of IntegerList. All you
need to do is to add the member function declaration (the body of the member function).
Rename the file prob2IntegerList.cpp. Submit it to the EPP - Problem 2 section on the class Titanium
site. If you wrote more than one file containing code, make sure to send and copy them as well.
Remember to put in your name and ID at the start of each file you turn in.
